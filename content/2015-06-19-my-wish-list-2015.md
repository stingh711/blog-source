Summary:

Keeping a list of things I want is always interesting.

This is the 2015 version.

1. EM10 + 17/1.8 + 48/1.8. I'm waiting for GRII to come out to decide which one to buy. However, its spec is so disappointing. So I will go with EM10 and waiting for GRIII.
1. Filofax original personal. 
1. iPad mini. Just waiting for the next generation.
1. Leica Q... After I saw http://www.stevehuffphoto.com/2015/06/22/68988/, I just want one even I know it is almost impossible.
1. Nothing else at present… 

I’m glad the list is not very long.
