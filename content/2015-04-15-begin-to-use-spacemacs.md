Summary: Begin to use spacemacs


[Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) is another emacs bundle like prelude. I came across it on company-mode's website. Its project description says it focuses on evil, so I decide to give it a try.

## The things I like so far.

1. Powerful. It includes almost everything I use before. Helm, projectile, yasnippet, python, web-mode, scss... I don't need to do much configuration to make it workable.
2. Almost all shortcuts are bound to SPACE. With guide-key, I can explore the key bindings quickly.

## Things I don't like.

1. I don't know how to do minor configuration change. For example, enable menu mode or change offset. Prelude has better document on these kinds of things.

I will update it later after I'm more familiar with it.
