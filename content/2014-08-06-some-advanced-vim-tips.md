Summary: Advance Vim tips

I will keep updating this post.

* `:sball` - Split all buffers...
* `map <f5> :ls<cr>:e #` - Press f5 to list all buffers. Choose a number and press enter, will jump to the relative buffer. Super quick, don't need bufferexplorer any more.
* `autocmd Filetype html nnoremap <tab> f"` - When editing html, I use it to find tag attribute which is useful for me.
