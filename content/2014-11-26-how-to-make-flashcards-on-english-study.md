Summary: How to make English flashcards


Flash cards and SRS is a good way to study English. But the difficult part is how to make flash cards. After some study on antimoon.com, I summarize some ways to do it.

## New word/pharase

Question: the meaning of the word/pharase
Answer: the word/pharase and a sample sentence.

Here is an example:

    Question:
    = a noise like the sound of something being crushed.
    Answer:
    crunch n. [kr^ntS]
    The only sound is the crunch of tyres on gravel.

Or you can give an example sentence in the question but leave the word empty. I can change the previous example as following:

    Question:
    = a noise like the sound of something being crushed.
    The only sound is the _ of tyres on gravel.
    Answer:
    crunch n. [kr^ntS]
    The only sound is the crunch of tyres on gravel.


## Sentence

Question: the meaning your want to express or the scenario you meet
Answer: the sentence

Here is an example:

    Question:
    In oral English, how do you express something needing courage to do it.
    Answer:
    It takes a lot of guts to do something...
    It certainly takes a lot of guts to jump one thousand feet above the water with only a rope tied to your legs.

I hope you will like it.
